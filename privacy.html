<main class="left">
  <h3>1. Who are we?</h3>
  <p>
    This is the privacy policy (“<strong>Policy</strong>” or
    <strong>“Privacy Policy</strong>”) of Join Together
    (“<strong>Join Together</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”,
    “<strong>our</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>”).
  </p>
  <p>
    Join Together is a software platform that allows workers to connect with and
    join trade unions. Join Together is a data controller in certain
    circumstances, and a data processor in relation to the services it provides
    to trade unions. In such circumstances, the trade unions are the data
    controllers. Join Together is committed to protecting the personal data
    that is provided to us and recognises the importance of protecting your
    information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Personal data means information that identifies you personally, for example
    your name, contact details or information that can be linked with such data
    in order to identify you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please take the time to read this Privacy Policy as it explains how we
    collect, use and store any personal data and the rights you have in
    relation to the protection of your personal data. If at any time, you have
    any concern or questions about your personal data, please get in touch at
    <a href="mailto:privacy@jointogether.online">privacy@jointogether.online</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>2. The data we process, how we use it and why</h3>
  <p>
    Join Together collects certain personal data in providing its services.
    This includes:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>When you are a trade union client:</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    When you work for a client of Join Together, we will collect certain
    information about you in order to provide our services to your
    organisation and perform the contract we have in place. We also may
    contact you where you have consented to be on our client mailing list.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may contact you for transactional matters via email regarding your
    usage of our services and to provide updates about new features or changes
    that we have made to our services so that you are able to make use of them
    effectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    This data is limited to name, contact details, job title, any information
    contained in our contracts with the trade union and any information
    contained in your correspondence and interaction with us.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>When you are using the website:</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    When you visit our website, certain data about your device is processed in
    order to maintain the security of the website. We undertake this
    processing for the purpose of preventing harm to the website from
    malicious users and traffic data.
  </p>
  <p>
    This data is limited to IP address and device type and is processed via
    essential session cookies on the basis of our legitimate interests in
    maintaining the security of the website.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also use non-cookie based analytics on our website that track anonymous
    analytics without the use of cookies. This does not include any personal
    data.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>When you are a staff or apply for a job:</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Where you are a staff member of Join Together or apply for a job with Join
    Together, we process your personal data in order to carry out the contract
    for employment that we have with you or on the basis of our legitimate
    interests for operating our business.
  </p>
  <p>
    This data includes your name, contact details, date of birth, CV data,
    education, the role you are applying for or job title and any information
    contained in our correspondence with you. Where you are an employee, we
    will also collect your salary, performance review details and information

  </p>
  <p>
    This data includes your name, contact details, job title and invoicing
    details.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Trade union applicant data:</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    We also process personal data on behalf of our trade union clients. We
    capture prospective members’ applications to join unions such as your
    name, payment data and other information regarding your application
    (“Applicant data”). We ensure the data is correctly formatted. Data is
    either transmitted onwards automatically to the client’s systems via
    secure and encrypted APIs or stored while the client downloads and
    processes the applications. Applicant data is controlled by the trade
    unions themselves, so for more information about this, please see the
    relevant trade union’s website.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Minors</h3>
  <p>
    In certain circumstances, depending on the relevant trade union, personal
    data of individuals under the age of 18 may be processed, however in no
    circumstances will personal data of any individuals under the age of 13
    be processed by Join Together. In addition, minors are not permitted to
    use this site, and we request that minors under the age of 18 not submit
    any personal data to the site.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Who we share your personal data with</h3>
  <p>
    We use EU instances of Heroku, a cloud-based hosting platform to store
    data which includes your personal data that is processed by us. We use
    Xero for invoices so our staff’s payment details and invoices are shared
    with Xero for that purpose.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use Mailchimp to send our mailing list members and trade union clients
    updates and marketing information where you have provided us with consent
    and in doing so, we share your email address and name with Mailchimp.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use Postmark to send transactional emails to confirm receipt of your
    union application and to help you resume an application if left
    incomplete. To do this we send Postmark your name, email address, and
    details included in the email such as the type of membership you applied
    for.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may also share your personal data with third parties who perform
    functions on our behalf or provide services to us such as professional
    advisors (such as accountants, lawyers, payroll service providers and IT
    consultants).
  </p>
  <p>
    We also use non-personal aggregated data to improve our services.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use an analytics service called MixPanel. We use Mixpanel to see how
    well our trade union join forms are performing by sending them anonymous
    information on the stages of the join form that you have reached and
    completed. This service neither receives nor stores personal data.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use an analytics service called Plausible. We use Plausible to
    understand how our website is being used and where visitors are coming
    from. We send Plausible anonymous information on the pages that you visit
    on our website, where the visit originated from (referrer), details of
    the device type (operating system; browser version), and your approximate
    location (country, region, city). This service neither receives nor
    stores personal data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Where we provide our services to trade unions, that trade union will be
    the data controller and will have access to your personal data in the
    event that you express interest in or register to apply for such trade
    union. Individual unions have access to their union’s data via a secure
    login. Each login is linked to an individual and all data access is
    logged. If the client wishes, we can even restrict logins to specific IP
    addresses.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your personal data may be shared in the event of a transfer of the assets
    or ownership of Join Together in connection with any proposed
    reorganisation or sale. We may also disclose personal data in the event
    of a legal requirement.
  </p>

  <h3>5. How long we keep your personal data for</h3>
  <p>
    Join Together has processes in place to ensure that it does not retain
    your personal data for longer than is necessary for the purposes it was
    originally collected, unless we have a legal or regulatory reason to keep
    it for a longer period.
  </p>
  <p>
    For more information on our retention periods, please contact us at
    <a href="mailto:privacy@jointogether.online">privacy@jointogether.online</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>6. International transfers</h3>
  <p>
    Join Together stores its personal data using EU instances of Heroku, a
    cloud-based hosting platform. We also use Mailchimp and Postmark which
    are based in the US. Where we transfer any personal data outside of the
    United Kingdom, we will (i) ensure that an adequate level of protection
    for that personal data is ensured by applicable data protection laws and
    (ii) in the absence of an adequate level of protection, provide
    appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses and/or
    (iii) enter into or establish any other appropriate instruments or
    undertakings required under applicable data protection laws to effect
    such data transfer without breach of such laws.
  </p>

  <h3>7. Automated decision-making</h3>
  <p>
    Join Together does not undertake any automated decision-making, including
    profiling.
  </p>

  <h3>8. Information security and risk mitigation</h3>
  <p>
    Join Together places a high priority on information security and has
    implemented a range of technical, organisational and legal safeguards to
    protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the personal
    data it processes and the data it processes. This includes:
    <ul>
      <li>
        All data is encrypted at rest
      </li>
      <li>
        All data is transferred via 256bit SSL
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
        Software libraries are monitored and updated regularly for security and
        bug fixes
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    websites. Please note that Join Together is not, and cannot, control or
    be responsible for the content or privacy and confidentiality practices

    privacy and confidentiality policy of any third party website that you
